# Password Generator

# Purpose

This password generator will create a random password. The user will be able to choose how many characters they would like the password to be between 8 and 50. Then they would be able to 'click' if they would like numbers, lower case letters, upper case letters, or special characters within the password. If a number lower than 8 or higher than 50 is selected, an alert would notify the user to select a number between 8 and 50. Click 'Generate Password' again and select the options for the next password to generate.
